# CVE-2023-6553 Exploit V1

## Description

The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via the /includes/backup-heart.php file. This is due to an attacker being able to control the values passed to an include, and subsequently leverage that to achieve remote code execution. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to easily execute code on the server.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal (make sure you are in the project directory):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Exploit

1. After installing the dependencies, you can run the exploit using the following command:

   ```bash
   python exploit.py <base_url>
   ```

   Replace `<base_url>` with the base URL of the target WordPress site. Make sure that the target site is vulnerable to CVE-2023-6553, and you have the appropriate authorization to perform testing.

   For example:

   ```bash
   python exploit.py https://example.com
   ```

   The exploit will attempt to exploit the vulnerability and write a PHP file on the target server.

## Using the Interactive Shell (if successful)

1. If the exploit successfully writes the PHP file on the target server, it will allow you to access an interactive shell to execute commands on the server.

2. The interactive shell is similar to a Unix terminal. You can enter commands and get the corresponding results.

3. To exit the interactive shell, simply enter the `exit` command.

4. You can also clear the screen by entering the `clear` command.

Please remember that using this exploit against systems for which you do not have explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the appropriate authorization before testing the vulnerability of a website.
